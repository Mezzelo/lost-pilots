,Personality,Character guidelines for chatter," Relies on her sensors a lot, for (apparently not that obvious) reasons. Sharp, conscientous, makes references to her education because quality writing."," Pessimistic, selfless to the point of hazard. Overcompensates for naivete, more caring than he lets on. Tends to trail off, but less than Justyn."," Seasoned, fast, but bitter. Draws more from anger and spite than most characters."," Old-timer, similar to Karlsson with a lesser emphasis on timlines (that is to say, being a failure) and more on conventional warfare."," Relatively new to mech combat, but experienced in other aspects of life. Comments a lot on physics and his own work in current timeline. Schmidt, but more emphatic - but still quiet."," Slightly neurotic, nervous, cowardly, but doesn't quite s-s-stutter about it. Slippery? I should really write backstories for these guys."," Soft spoken, laconic, seemingly emotionless as virtues of fierce concentration and dedication to the job. Equal parts training, personality, and proper grasp of the gravitas. Catastrophic failure may cause her to falter, but she mostly just doubles down."," Ruthless, curt, pragmatic. Nickname is ironic, much like Abe's. Not necessarily evil but still lacking empathy, at least outwardly. Units under her are often sacrificed, but to great tactical effect."," oh boy this is gonna be fun to write."," Worked in Detritus treating workplace accidents 'and more' with 'pharmaceutical expertise'. Surrounded by motifs of sleep and illusion. Generally sagely, easygoing, detatched and slightly optimistic. Usually sympathetic, but sometimes a bit cruel and callous. Carries unknown baggage with Singh likely related to his past."," Pinnacle climatologist, understands Vek intrusion will wipe out all life on Earth. Carries an air of esteem and dignity in the most dire of moments, but isn't a research freak like Schmidt or Renfield: He's on the field to take action, and he knows his way around a mech."," Regular operator for antiquated Archive machinery, mechs are new to her but she's used to adjusting to strange tech. Quick and insightful, but naiive. Something of a daredevil. Probably the most cheerful of any of these pilots."
